# Html_First_Chair_Site

This repo includes one page site for an online chair shop.
It was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The main goal was to make it look as similar to the warsztat1.jpg file as possible.
But for this requirement, the site would not have so many unnecessary margins/paddings.
- Site was made using PerfectPixel
- It is not supposed to work properly on mobile devices

<b>JavaScript consists of some scripts:</b>
- hiding names when hovering mouse over chair picture
- slider that gives an opportunity to see other sections
